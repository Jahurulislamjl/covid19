                        People may be sick with the virus for 1 to 14 days before developing symptoms. The most common
                        symptoms of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Most people
                        (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        More rarely, the disease can be serious and even fatal. Older people, and people with other
                        medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, or heart disease), may be more vulnerable to
                        becoming severely ill.
